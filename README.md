Open Space Kontrol intends to provide telemetry and remote control to Kerbal Space Program vessels via Open Sound Control.

OSC seems a natural fit for providing low-latency control inputs and telemetry data. When complete, Open Space Kontrol will enable anything that can speak OSC to operate as a KSP controller. In particular, OSK will target (TouchOSC)[http://hexler.net/software/touchosc] a network-attached control surface.
