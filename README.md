Open Space Kontrol intends to provide telemetry and remote control to Kerbal Space Program vessels via [Open Sound Control](http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc).

OSC is a natural fit for providing low-latency control inputs and telemetry data.

When complete, Open Space Kontrol will enable anything that can speak OSC to operate as a KSP controller. In particular, OSK will target [TouchOSC](http://hexler.net/software/touchosc) as a network-attached, bi-directional control surface. However, OSC is _by definition_ an open protocol, so there's nothing stopping you from controlling KSP with your favorite language, microcontroller, synthesizer or midi control surface (a [Launchpad](http://global.novationmusic.com/launch) perhaps? :sunglasses:).

In its current state, only a few telemetry numbers are transmitted, and vessel control is not implemented.
